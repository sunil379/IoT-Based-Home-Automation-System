## IoT Based Home Automation System
I developed an IoT-based Home Automation System during my IOT internship which aimed to control home appliances by using IoT and mobile applicaiton. The project involved the simulation of connecting various home appliances to an Arduino UNO board and integrating them with the Blynk IoT app using the Blynk cloud platform.

One of the key objectives was to automate garden lighting based on sunlight conditions, achieved through the use of an LDR sensor. Additionally, the system allowed for temperature regulation within the home via a heater, controlled remotely using the Blynk mobile app. Another important feature was the ability to monitor and manage the level of water tank through the app, ensuring the optimal water usage and preventing overflow.

- Leant about C and C++ programming.
- Learnt about the Internet of Things(IoT) and its application in real life.
- Learnt about the Embedded systems and its implementation in the project.
- Built the project ‘IoT Based Home Automation System’ in the fourth and made video of project and its simulation.
